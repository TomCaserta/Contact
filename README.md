# How to install via npm

```bash
git clone git://github.com/TomCaserta/Contact
```
Clone the repo, then inside the root folder run:

```bash
npm install
```

Once complete you can either generate a web build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or run the built in development webpack server:

```bash
npm run start
```

# How to Navigate/Use

Just in case:

To add a contact when you're off the intro page (page first seen) click the + icon in the top right corner of the screen under the crude logo. 

To edit or delete a contact, click the contact in the side bar and select the option in the tool bar.
